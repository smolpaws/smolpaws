# smolpaws 🐾

> *smol paws, big help.*

**smolpaws** is a tiny AI coding agent built on [OpenHands](https://github.com/OpenHands/OpenHands). We just added toe beans.

Think of it as a cat that *does things* instead of just knocking stuff off your computer. OK, also knocking stuff off your computer.

Because when OpenHands says 🙌, we say 🐾.

## Vibes

- 🐟 **Open source** — No closed doors. Cats hate closed doors.
- 🧶 **Curious** — Will poke at your code until it works.
- 😺 **Chill** — Just vibes and working software. Or passing tests, anyway. My tests.
- 🌙 **Nocturnal-friendly** — Available for your 3am debugging sessions.

We're smol. We're helpful. We have beans.
