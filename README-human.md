  Your smart cat. Lightweight, secure, customizable.

Powered by the published `@smolpaws/agent-sdk` package. The canonical TypeScript runtime source lives in `enyst/OpenHands-Tab/packages/agent-sdk`, and this repo consumes that runtime in `container/agent-runner`. Built on [OpenHands](https://github.com/OpenHands/OpenHands). Based on [NanoClaw](https://github.com/gavrielc/nanoclaw).

## Why

[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) is an impressive project with a great vision. But I can't sleep well running software I don't understand with access to my life. OpenClaw has 52+ modules, 8 config management files, 45+ dependencies, and abstractions for 15 channel providers. Security is application-level (allowlists, pairing codes) rather than OS isolation. Everything runs in one Node process with shared memory.

SmolPaws gives you the same core functionality in a codebase you can understand in 8 minutes. One process. A handful of files. Agents run in actual Linux containers with filesystem isolation, not behind permission checks.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smolpaws/smolpaws.git
cd smolpaws
claude
```

Then run `/setup`. Claude Code handles everything: dependencies, authentication, container setup, service configuration.

## Philosophy

**Small enough to understand.** One process, a few source files. No microservices, no message queues, no abstraction layers. Have Claude Code walk you through it.

**Secure by isolation.** Agents run in Linux containers (Apple Container on macOS, or Docker). They can only see what's explicitly mounted. Bash access is safe because commands run inside the container, not on your host.

**Built for one user.** This isn't a framework. It's working software that fits my exact needs. You fork it and have Claude Code make it match your exact needs.

**Customization = code changes.** No configuration sprawl. Want different behavior? Modify the code. The codebase is small enough that this is safe.

**AI-native.** No installation wizard; Claude Code guides setup. No monitoring dashboard; ask Claude what's happening. No debugging tools; describe the problem, Claude fixes it.

**Skills over features.** Contributors shouldn't add features (e.g. support for Telegram) to the codebase. Instead, they contribute [claude code skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) like `/add-telegram` that transform your fork. You end up with clean code that does exactly what you need, not a bloated system trying to support every use case.

**Best harness, best model.** This runs on OpenHands Agent SDK, giving agents access to terminal, file editing, and tool use. The harness matters. A bad harness makes even smart models seem dumb, a good harness gives them superpowers.

## What It Supports

- **WhatsApp I/O** - Message Claude from your phone
- **Isolated group context** - Each group has its own `AGENTS.md` memory, isolated filesystem, and runs in its own container sandbox with only that filesystem mounted
- **Main channel** - Your private channel (self-chat) for admin control; every other group is completely isolated
- **Scheduled tasks** - Recurring jobs that run Claude and can message you back
- **Web access** - Search and fetch content
- **Container isolation** - Agents sandboxed in Apple Container (macOS) or Docker (macOS/Linux)
- **Optional integrations** - Add Gmail (`/add-gmail`) and more via skills

## Usage

Talk to your assistant with the trigger word (default: `@smolpaws`):

```
@smolpaws send an overview of the sales pipeline every weekday morning at 9am (has access to my Obsidian vault folder)
@smolpaws review the git history for the past week each Friday and update the README if there's drift
@smolpaws every Monday at 8am, compile news on AI developments from Hacker News and TechCrunch and message me a briefing
```

From the main channel (your self-chat), you can manage groups and tasks:
```
@smolpaws list all scheduled tasks across groups
@smolpaws pause the Monday briefing task
@smolpaws join the Family Chat group
```

## Customizing

There are no configuration files to learn. Just tell Claude Code what you want:

- "Change the trigger word to @Bob"
- "Remember in the future to make responses shorter and more direct"
- "Add a custom greeting when I say good morning"
- "Store conversation summaries weekly"

Or run `/customize` for guided changes.

The codebase is small enough that Claude can safely modify it.

## Contributing

**Don't add features. Add skills.**

If you want to add Telegram support, don't create a PR that adds Telegram alongside WhatsApp. Instead, contribute a skill file (`.claude/skills/add-telegram/SKILL.md`) that teaches Claude Code how to transform a SmolPaws installation to use Telegram.

Users then run `/add-telegram` on their fork and get clean code that does exactly what they need, not a bloated system trying to support every use case.

### RFS (Request for Skills)

Skills we'd love to see:

**Communication Channels**
- `/add-telegram` - Add Telegram as channel. Should give the user option to replace WhatsApp or add as additional channel. Also should be possible to add it as a control channel (where it can trigger actions) or just a channel that can be used in actions triggered elsewhere
- `/add-slack` - Add Slack
- `/add-discord` - Add Discord

**Platform Support**
- `/setup-windows` - Windows via WSL2 + Docker

**Session Management**
- `/add-clear` - Add a `/clear` command that compacts the conversation (summarizes context while preserving critical information in the same session).

## Requirements

- macOS or Linux
- Node.js 20+
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/download)
- [Apple Container](https://github.com/apple/container) (macOS) or [Docker](https://docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (macOS/Linux)

## Architecture

```
WhatsApp (baileys) --> SQLite --> Polling loop --> Container (OpenHands Agent SDK) --> Response
```

Single Node.js process. Agents execute in isolated Linux containers with mounted directories. IPC via filesystem. No daemons, no queues, no complexity.

Runtime ownership:
- Canonical TypeScript runtime source: `enyst/OpenHands-Tab/packages/agent-sdk`
- Distribution path used here: published npm package `@smolpaws/agent-sdk`

Key files:
- `src/index.ts` - Main app: WhatsApp connection, routing, IPC
- `src/container-runner.ts` - Spawns agent containers
- `src/task-scheduler.ts` - Runs scheduled tasks
- `src/db.ts` - SQLite operations
- `groups/*/AGENTS.md` - Per-group memory

## FAQ

**Why WhatsApp and not Telegram/Signal/etc?**

Because I use WhatsApp. Fork it and run a skill to change it. That's the whole point.

**Why Apple Container instead of Docker?**

On macOS, Apple Container is lightweight, fast, and optimized for Apple silicon. But Docker is also fully supported—during `/setup`, you can choose which runtime to use. On Linux, Docker is used automatically.

**Can I run this on Linux?**

Yes. Run `/setup` and it will automatically configure Docker as the container runtime. Thanks to [@dotsetgreg](https://github.com/dotsetgreg) for contributing the `/convert-to-docker` skill.

**Is this secure?**

Agents run in containers, not behind application-level permission checks. They can only access explicitly mounted directories. You should still review what you're running, but the codebase is small enough that you actually can. See [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) for the full security model.

**Why no configuration files?**

We don't want configuration sprawl. Every user should customize it to so that the code matches exactly what they want rather than configuring a generic system. If you like having config files, tell Claude to add them.

**How do I debug issues?**

Ask Claude Code. "Why isn't the scheduler running?" "What's in the recent logs?" "Why did this message not get a response?" That's the AI-native approach.

**Why isn't the setup working for me?**

I don't know. Run `claude`, then run `/debug`. If claude finds an issue that is likely affecting other users, open a PR to modify the setup SKILL.md.

**What changes will be accepted into the codebase?**

Security fixes, bug fixes, and clear improvements to the base configuration. That's it.

Everything else (new capabilities, OS compatibility, hardware support, enhancements) should be contributed as skills.

This keeps the base system minimal and lets every user customize their installation without inheriting features they don't want.
